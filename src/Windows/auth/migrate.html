                    To use ChatGuessr, you have to log in with Twitch. We recommend logging in using a bot account or second account, not your main streamer account.
                </p>

                <div class="card danger">
                    <p>
                        ChatGuessr versions <strong>1.1.0-alpha.0</strong> and <strong>2.0.0</strong>, released on the 25th of March, contain a security issue that could expose your OAuth token to the ChatGuessr developers.
                        This token could theoretically give ChatGuessr developers moderation access in your Twitch channel through your bot account.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We obviously have no use for this access and should never have had it.
                        The token was never stored anywhere and never seen by a human, but we recommend revoking it anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please see the <a href="https://chatguessr.com/security" target="_blank">security announcement</a> for instructions on how to do that and more information on what happened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With this new version, the ChatGuessr client requires <em>less</em> access than before, and this access is not exposed anymore, so a similar mistake can not occur again.
                        We apologise for the broken trust.
